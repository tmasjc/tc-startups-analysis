The company promises 26 tero operations per second in performance from its chip, which it says &#8221; outperforms all other edge processors with its small size, high performance, and low power consumption.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/media-1313468-hailoarchitectureconcept.jpg\"><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1954683\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/media-1313468-hailoarchitectureconcept.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"999\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/media-1313468-hailoarchitectureconcept.jpg 2820w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/media-1313468-hailoarchitectureconcept.jpg?resize=150,146 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/media-1313468-hailoarchitectureconcept.jpg?resize=300,293 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/media-1313468-hailoarchitectureconcept.jpg?resize=768,749 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/media-1313468-hailoarchitectureconcept.jpg?resize=680,663 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/media-1313468-hailoarchitectureconcept.jpg?resize=1536,1498 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/media-1313468-hailoarchitectureconcept.jpg?resize=2048,1997 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/media-1313468-hailoarchitectureconcept.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/media-1313468-hailoarchitectureconcept.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>With this round, Hailo&#8217;s total funding is now $88 million.

It affected our confidence, our jobs and we didn\u2019t know who to talk to and what to do,&#8221; says Suryaputra. &#8220;Even going to the doctor for treatment was an awkward process and it was expensive to pay for medications. We talked to other men and they faced the same issues.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Hair loss treatments with minoxidil and finasteride, the two most common clinically-proven ingredients, require a prescription in Indonesia and it can be difficult to book consultations since the country has a relatively low number of physicians. The price of a doctor\u2019s visit, which the founding team says is usually about US $30, and treatments, is also prohibitive for many people.<\/p>\n<p>Newman&#8217;s works directly with manufacturers for its hair loss products, which contain minoxidil and finasteride. By cutting out distribution and retail middlemen, their margins are higher, and they use some of that revenue to pay doctors on the platform. This enables them to make consultations free and also offer a 100% money-back guarantee to encourage patients to use products for at least three months, since it usually takes that amount of time to see results.<\/p>\n<p>For doctors, online consultations through Newman\u2019s platform saves time and allows them to see more patients. Before booking an appointment for hair loss, Newman&#8217;s users complete a questionnaire and upload photos, which help their doctors determine treatments and shorten consultation times for hair loss to as little as five minutes. There are currently about 15 doctors on Newman\u2019s (with plans to add more from a waiting list) who see about 10 to 15 patients through the platform per day.<\/p>\n<p>The startup will launch in other men\u2019s health verticals before expanding into women\u2019s health, with an emphasis on issues that patients are often reluctant to seek help for because of stigma or cost.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Right now we\u2019re focused on hair loss because it personally affects us and a lot of other men,&#8221; says Suryaputra. &#8220;With other verticals, like erectile dysfunction, there are the same dynamics. It\u2019s embarrassing and in Southeast Asia, the taboo around erectile dysfunction is a lot stronger than in the United States.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Newman&#8217;s will continue to focus on Indonesia, where data from the World Bank <a href=\"https:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/SH.MED.PHYS.ZS\">shows there are much less physicians per 1,000 patients<\/a> than in the United States or nearby countries like Thailand and Singapore.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We cannot create more doctors, so we have to make seeing patients more efficient for them,&#8221; says Suryaputra.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An Indonesian startup called Newman&#8217;s is using telemedicine to help Indonesian patients get care for stigmatized health issues.

This self-described &#8220;grizzled veteran&#8221; of the industry has participated in companies that have collectively taken half a dozen drugs to market, though she typically prefers to work with seed-stage companies and even to help create them. (She&#8217;s helping bake one at Venrock now with a founder who has been in the firm&#8217;s portfolio for numerous years.)<\/p>\n<p>We talked with Samuels earlier today to see if she sees any opportunity in disaster &#8212; specifically, the coronavirus that has so much of the world on pins and needles. She explained why going after infectious diseases is tricky from a funding and company-building standpoint, and why what really excites her is aging biology. Parts of our chat, edited lightly for length, follow:<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Every day, we&#8217;re seeing more coronavirus cases in the U.S. and other parts of the world grappling with this. Do you see opportunity in this disaster?<\/strong><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>CS: Well, It wouldn&#8217;t make sense for me to create a de novo business today [around this coronavirus]. The reason that infectious disease is hard is pricing permissiveness.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Meaning&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>CS: The reason you hear about cancer and orphan diseases so much is that you can price high in those areas. In therapeutic areas where you can&#8217;t price high because there are already a bunch of generics on the market &#8212; pain, depression, other huge unmet needs &#8212; you don&#8217;t see as much innovation.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a matter of [businesses] following the incentives. With infectious disease, you&#8217;ve got this problem that maybe someone even a year ago predicted might become a problem, but when it&#8217;s a potential and not an actual problem, it&#8217;s hard to get investors to fund something like that.<\/p>\n<p>Also, this is something that mutated in animals and got into humans, so we couldn&#8217;t have come up with a therapeutic ahead of time. Even if a [vaccine] is created now, it inevitably won&#8217;t cure what [new virus] comes next, which explains the pricing permissiveness. If [a cure comes along], isn&#8217;t it your instinct to give it away for free? It is mine. On top of that, if someone survives Covid-19, it&#8217;s done. They&#8217;re no longer a potential customer. In tech, [founders and investors] want to create products that people interact with three times a day for the rest of their lives.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: So we shouldn&#8217;t hold our breath for a coronavirus vaccine? Doesn&#8217;t Gilead have something in the works? I saw its shares were soaring.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>CS: Gilead is soaring because it has an anti-viral that may work already in these patients. There are companies that have technology to apply today that might help, but don&#8217;t expect a bunch of new companies around Covid-19 because that&#8217;s yesterday&#8217;s problem by the time these drugs get to market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: As an investor, how do you break down what&#8217;s worth funding? Are there certain verticals that you&#8217;re chasing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>CS:\u00a0 At Venrock, we try not to be heuristic driven [based on rules of thumb]. We think [it can lead to] lazy thinking or saying no to something that could be awesome. Instead, we look to do orthogonal investing to address big unmet needs with great people. So for me, aging biology has been lighting my fire for many years now.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m on the board of Unity [a company that went public in 2018 and is working on drugs and treatments that can make people free of the diseases associated with aging for as long as possible]. I&#8217;m [involved with Venrock-backed] Corvidia, which is working on reducing inflammation in people with kidney disease who functionally die of heart disease. I&#8217;m forming a seed startup right now around a founder who is focused on aging. In general,\u00a0 the big idea of improving health span is what really interests me. I want us to extend out the years that we can be healthy and happy versus on medication and decrepit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: I understand that you&#8217;re a health fanatic.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>CS: In my personal life, I am. I exercise like crazy, I take supplements, I eat my veggies, I do all the meditation apps and hang out with my kids and pet our dog.\u00a0 [I also do] time-restricted eating, or intermittent fasting, meaning not eating during 14- to 16-hour windows.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Why do this?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>CS: On a macro level, your body will only start burning fat 12 hours after your last meal. But the health reason ties to a process called cell autophagy, which you can think of like the garbage disposal for your body&#8217;s damaged cells [making way for newer, healthier cells]. It&#8217;s a process that starts to decline in function as we age; it doesn&#8217;t function as well as can sicken the [good] cells, and [the fasting helps kickstart that process].<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Does this explain your interest in Unity?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>CS: With Unity, one day, some time ago, I was reading the New York Times, and there was an image of two mice that were brothers. One looked ancient. It was gray, bent, small, its eyes had cataracts. The other mouse looked terrific. One had gotten an intervention and the other didn&#8217;t. And I emailed [Unity founder and serial entrepreneur] Ned David and I said, &#8216;Ned, I think this is your next company.&#8217; I was apparently the third person to email him this. It just smelled like a Ned project. But I&#8217;m often there at the very beginning and for me, that provides me with the most personal satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: What do you say to skeptics?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>CS: If you&#8217;re familiar with the Gartner hype cycle, it&#8217;s hype, then disillusionment, and only after that does real value get added. There was a lot of hype in biology, 10 to 15 years ago, and companies like Unity are still having to contend with the hangover from that bacchanalia. But I don&#8217;t think much is overhyped in biotech right now. I think other investors are going to discover aging biology in the next couple of years as being really important.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Camille Samuels has spent the last five years as a partner with the healthcare venture firm Venrock and a dozen years before that with Versant Ventures, where she was a managing director.

Amid skyrocketing rents and a homeless crisis, there have been ample concerns that the structures in the city are being overstressed, low and moderate income residents are being pushed out and that the influx of tech startups is exacerbating the problem.<\/p>\n<p>San Francisco had already been operating under voter-imposed annual limits for new office space via Prop M, a 1986 ballot measure that has limited annual office space allocations to 875,000 square feet of large office space (defined as a building with more than 50,000 square feet). Prop E ties this office space maximum to regionally determined affordable housing goals, ones aimed much higher than San Francisco has been able to hit in recent years.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In the past decade, SF has built an average of 712 affordable housing units per year, according to the chief economist&#8217;s report. In the past 20 years, San Francisco&#8217;s annual affordable housing production has popped above 1,000 units only once. The latest goals, set by a state program, pin annual affordable housing production at 2,042 units per year. With Prop E, if San Francisco fell short of that annual goal, only building one-third of those 2,042 units, they would also only be able to allocate one-third of its 875,000 large-space square footage to new large-space projects.<\/p>\n<p>Scarcity in office space has been a consistent issue for startups in SF. Last year, Stripe, one of the world&#8217;s most highly valued startups, cemented plans to leave San Francisco, citing the scarcity of office space in the city as part of its decision to leave, the San Francisco Chronicle <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sfchronicle.com\/business\/article\/35-billion-startup-Stripe-considers-move-out-of-14453688.php\">reported<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Prop E\u2019s passage is perhaps the worst institutional political failure I\u2019ve seen in my 23 years in SF.<\/p>\n<p>Prop E is a dumpster fire.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2018ll reduce $ for affordable housing\/transit, cost SF\u2019s general fund billions, push out start-ups\/nonprofits &amp; fuel office sprawl (w increased VMT). <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/97p2RZNAPO\">https:\/\/t.co\/97p2RZNAPO<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Scott Wiener (@Scott_Wiener) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Scott_Wiener\/status\/1235303246870261762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 4, 2020<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>Mayor London Breed did not support Prop E, and the city&#8217;s own chief economist estimated Prop E would go on to cost the city tens of millions of dollars in revenues and thousands of jobs per year, limiting the city&#8217;s GDP growth by tens of billions over the next 20 years.

He has experience in data and operations at Fortune 500 companies and tech startups and has been a regular contributor at Seeking Alpha, Spend Matters, Metal Miner, and other publications.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\">Across the U.S., sustainable microgrids are emerging as a vital tool in the fight against climate change and increasingly common natural disasters. In the wake of hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires, the traditional energy grid in many parts of the country is struggling to keep the power flowing, causing outages that slow local economies and ultimately put lives at risk.<\/p>\n<p>Microgrids \u2014 power installations that are designed to run independently from the wider electricity grid in emergency situations \u2014 have been around for decades, but until the turn of the century, relied almost exclusively on fossil fuels to generate power. While it\u2019s taken another 20 years for solar panels and battery storage costs to fall far enough to make truly sustainable microgrids an economic reality, a recent surge in interest and installations have shown that they&#8217;ve reached an inflection point and could very well be the future of clean energy.<\/p>\n<p>Take Santa Barbara, where the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.independent.com\/2020\/01\/03\/s-b-school-district-to-go-off-the-grid\/\">Unified School District voted unanimously in November<\/a> to allocate over $500,000 to study and design microgrid installations for schools around the county. A preliminary assessment by the Clean Coalition identified more than 15 megawatts of solar generation potential across 18 school sites.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>These solar-plus-battery-storage microgrids would greatly enhance the ability of chosen schools to serve communities during natural disasters or power outages, like the ones <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/10\/23\/pge-rebuked-over-imposing-blackouts-in-california-to-reduce-fire-risk.html\">induced by California\u2019s PG&amp;E electric utility<\/a> that affected hundreds of thousands of residents last October. The sites will provide a place to coordinate essential emergency services, store perishable food and provide residents with light, power and connectivity in times of distress.<\/p>\n<p>A completed feasibility study for the microgrid installations is expected in June, and while initial estimates put the final cost around $40 million, long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) will allow the school district to have the sites set up for free and paid for over time via its normal electric bill \u2014 at a cost no greater than grid power. Agreements like these have only become economically viable in the last few years as renewable energy generation costs have continued to fall, and are a major driver of the microgrid boom.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of January, Scale Microgrid Solutions <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/scale-microgrid-solutions-announces-equity-commitment-of-up-to-300-million-from-warburg-pincus-300993562.html\">received a commitment for $300 million<\/a> in funding from investment firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.warburgpincus.com\/\">Warburg Pincus<\/a>. Microgrids today are typically designed and installed to the unique specifications of individual customers. Scale Microgrid Solutions instead provides modular microgrid infrastructure built using shipping containers that combine solar and battery storage with control equipment and backup gas generation.<\/p>\n<p>These modules enable faster deployment and provide a viable option for customers or institutions seeking microgrid capabilities in the $15 million price range. The first modular microgrids were launched in May 2019 with financing provided by <a href=\"https:\/\/generatecapital.com\/\">Generate Capital<\/a>, a financing firm focused on advanced, clean-energy technology investments.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, on the opposite side of the country, successive disasters are already proving the value of solar-plus-storage microgrids in Puerto Rico. In 2017, Hurricane Maria catastrophically damaged the centralized electricity grid in the U.S. territory and left many without power for more than a year.<\/p>\n<p>A project funded by the Rocky Mountain Institute, Save the Children and Kinesis Foundation <a href=\"https:\/\/www.environmentalleader.com\/2020\/01\/earthquake-puerto-rico-microgrids\/\">installed solar-plus-battery-storage microgrids at 10 schools<\/a> in the mountainous central regions of the island, designed to provide energy for on-site libraries, kitchens and water pumps indefinitely during power outages. The installations were completed in December 2019, just weeks before a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wusa9.com\/article\/news\/investigations\/puerto-rico-earthquakes-we-are-not-okay-yuaco-ponce\/65-2333eb9a-5121-4cb3-ae95-2633d93843dc\">series of earthquakes that began in January<\/a> endangered the island&#8217;s already sluggish economic recovery. <a href=\"https:\/\/microgridknowledge.com\/school-microgrids-up-and-running-despite-earthquake-and-massive-power-outage-in-puerto-rico\/\">The RMI Island Energy Program told Microgrid Knowledge<\/a> that while grid power around several of the sites had gone down, the microgrids had continued to operate successfully and provide critical services.<\/p>\n<p>Microgrids go beyond schools though. Several communities are also linking solar-and-storage systems mounted on their homes, employing inverters and controllers that have only become efficient and affordable in the last few years to create &#8220;community microgrids&#8221; that share power among the participants to supplement or replace grid energy.<\/p>\n<p>In January,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pv-magazine-australia.com\/2020\/02\/13\/melbourne-energy-storage-startup-set-to-charge-into-u-s-market\/\">Australian startup Relectrify<\/a> closed $4.5 million in Series A funding to continue refining their inverter and battery-management technology that increases battery lifespan by as much as 30% while reducing operational costs. Relectrify tech also allows large batteries from electric cars \u2014 including Tesla\u2019s wildly popular offerings \u2014 to be repurposed after they are no longer reliable enough for use in EVs, opening up an enormous pool of second-hand batteries to be repurposed for growing microgrid storage demand.<\/p>\n<p>Programs like these are attractive not just because they offer resilience and independence from grid power often produced with fossil fuels, but because they are <a href=\"https:\/\/spectrum.ieee.org\/energy\/policy\/how-to-harden-puerto-ricos-grid-against-hurricanes\">increasingly the cheaper option for energy consumers<\/a>. Residential retail energy prices in Puerto Rico were as high as 27 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 2019, while the calculated cost from home solar-plus-battery-storage systems fell as low as 24 cents in good conditions.<\/p>\n<p>The cost of solar installations has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greentechmedia.com\/articles\/read\/solar-pv-has-become-cheaper-and-better-in-the-2010s-now-what\">plummeted 90% in the past decade<\/a> according to the research firm Wood Mackenzie. At the same time, the early effects of a warming climate and associated natural disasters have started to take a toll on American energy infrastructure already struggling to keep pace with regular maintenance and demand growth. Impacted communities have already seen the value of microgrids and are racing to adopt them, even as many larger utility providers look to <a href=\"https:\/\/theintercept.com\/2020\/02\/09\/puerto-rico-energy-electricity-solar-natural-gas\/\">natural gas<\/a> or other partial solutions that rely on the aging centralized power grid.<\/p>\n<p>The greatest impact of these early sustainable microgrids may reach beyond the emergency power they provide to nearby residents. They offer a glimpse of a radically different way for communities and energy consumers to think about how power is produced and used. In community microgrid systems, residents have a concrete, practical connection to their source of energy and are asked to work together with their friends and neighbors to control their energy demand so there is enough to go around.<\/p>\n<p>Such a system stands in stark contrast to the power grid of today, where peak demand facilities are routinely called upon to burn some of the most environmentally harmful fuels to accommodate demand with few if any social or technological limitations. Sustainable microgrids are finally becoming truly affordable, and in the process are beginning to change the way we think about energy consumption and resilience.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Across the U.S., sustainable microgrids are emerging as a vital tool in the fight against climate change and increasingly common natural disasters.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":15408904,"featured_media":1954598,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"jetpack_publicize_message":"Sustainable microgrids are the future of clean energy https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/38ofepV"},"categories":[25515,1102388],"tags":[16897,300922,935858],"crunchbase_tag":[218822977],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/GettyImages-957099668.jpg","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/38ofepV","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"tc_cb_mapping":[{"slug":"warburg-pincus","cb_name":"Warburg Pincus","cb_slug":"warburg-pincus-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/warburg-pincus"}],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[1954582],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1954552"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1954552"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1954552\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1954643,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1954552\/revisions\/1954643"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/alex-behrens"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=1954552&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/15408904"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1954598"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1954552"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1954552"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1954552"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=1954552"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=1954552"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=1954552"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1954514,"date":"2020-03-04T13:13:14","date_gmt":"2020-03-04T21:13:14","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/?p=1954514"},"modified":"2020-03-04T13:13:14","modified_gmt":"2020-03-04T21:13:14","slug":"oyo-layoffs-airbnbs-delayed-ipo-and-the-long-term-quandary-of-investing-in-travel-startups","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/04\/oyo-layoffs-airbnbs-delayed-ipo-and-the-long-term-quandary-of-investing-in-travel-startups\/","title":{"rendered":"Oyo layoffs, Airbnb\u2019s delayed IPO and the long-term quandary of investing in travel startups"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">It\u2019s the best<\/span> and worst of times for travel startups.<\/p>\n<p>Massive growth over the past few decades has made tourism one of the big global industries, covering everything from recreation to business conferences to shopping sprees.<\/p>\n<p>But doubts about the future of the industry are growing \u2014 and not just because of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19.

Wall Street Journal<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The company declined to disclose exactly who invested in the new round (which is always a great sign) and didn&#8217;t comment on how the new investment would effect the company&#8217;s valuation.<\/p>\n<p>Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman told the Journal that the new financing was made to ensure that the company would have the financial flexibility and runway to build a long-term business, but it&#8217;s likely that companies as diverse as Brandless and WeWork said the same thing about their goals when raising capital, as well.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"paywall\">\n<p>According to the story in the WSJ, the company&#8217;s new investment contains both existing investors, like the Alibaba Group and Hollywood Studios, along with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wndrco.com\/\">WndrCo<\/a>, the investment firm and holding company launched by Quibi&#8217;s co-founder and Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg.<\/p>\n<p>To date, Quibi has raised $1.75 billion.<\/p>\n<p>While the company touts its original approach to storytelling, and its list of marquee talent developing series for the app, the emphasis on short-form <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/01\/08\/quibis-biggest-challenge-convincing-you-to-sign-up-for-another-service.html\">has been tried before<\/a>\u00a0by other companies (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/29\/verizon-is-shutting-down-go90\/\">notably TechCrunch&#8217;s own parent company<\/a>)&#8230; and the results were less than promising.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that people need to consume short-form stories instead of &#8230; maybe just hitting the pause button&#8230; is interesting as an experiment to see what kinds of narratives or reality show-style entertainment needs to live behind a paywall rather than on YouTube or TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps Quibi will win with its slate of reality and narrative shows (which, to be honest, look pretty fun). The big names that Katzenberg and co-founder Meg Whitman promised are certainly on offer in the roster that is helpfully synopsized <a href=\"https:\/\/ew.com\/tv\/2019\/06\/13\/quibi-projects-jeffrey-katzenberg\/\">in a recent Entertainment Weekly article<\/a> about the company&#8217;s programming.<\/p>\n<p>Quibi, unlike some of the streaming services that it&#8217;s going to compete with, doesn&#8217;t have a back catalog of titles to tap to pad out the service, so it&#8217;s coming to market with a whopping 175 shows in its first year with 8,500 episodes, which run no longer than 10 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>When it launches, there will be 50 shows on offer from the service. A lot depends on the reception of those shows. While many of the titles seem compelling, there are only a couple that seem to have the appeal to break through to the audience that Quibi hopes it can reach, and that will be willing to shell out money for its subscriptions.<\/p>\n<p>The service is also hoping to differentiate itself by dropping new episodes daily &#8212; rather than weekly releases common on network television or the season-long binges that Netflix encourages.<\/p>\n<p>The app itself seems to be fairly undifferentiated from the services available from other streamers. As we wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/20\/quibis-streaming-service-app-launches-in-app-stores-for-pre-order\/\">when the company launched pre-orders for its app<\/a> in February:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Much has been made about Quibi\u2019s potential to reimagine TV by taking advantage of mobile technology in new ways, but the app itself looks much like any other streaming service, save for its last app store screenshot showing off its TurnStyle technology.<\/p>\n<p>The app appears to favor a dark theme common to streaming apps, like Netflix and Prime Video, with just four main navigation buttons at the bottom.<\/p>\n<p>The first is a personalized For You page, where you\u2019re presented a feed where you\u2019ll discover new things Quibi thinks you\u2019ll like.<\/p>\n<p>A Search tab will point you toward trending shows and it will allow you to search by show titles, genre or even mood.<\/p>\n<p>The Following tab helps you keep track of your favorite shows and a Downloads tab keeps track of those you\u2019ve made available for offline viewing.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise, Quibi\u2019s interface is fairly simple. Shows are displayed with big images that you flip through either vertically on your home feed or both horizontally and vertically as you move through the Browse section.<\/p>\n<p>The company does promote its TurnStyle viewing technology in its app store description, though it doesn\u2019t reference the technology by name. Instead, it describes it as a viewing experience that puts you in full control. \u201cNo matter how you hold your phone, everything is framed to fit your screen,\u201d it says.<\/p>\n<p>In vertical viewing mode, it also introduces controls that appear on either the left or right side the screen \u2014 you choose, based on whether you\u2019re left or right-handed.<\/p>\n<p>Quibi did not formally announce the app was open for pre-order.<\/p>\n<p>The startup, founded by Jeffrey Katzenberg, is backed by more than a billion dollars \u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-01-08\/moguls-whitman-katzenberg-raise-400-million-for-quibi-service\">including a recently closed $400 million round<\/a>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/div>\n<p>Despite the doubt surrounding its success, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/23\/streaming-service-quibi-sells-out-of-its-150m-in-first-year-ad-inventory\/\">Quibi managed to sell out of the initial $150 million in available advertising for the service&#8217;s first year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s as big of a hit with potential subscribers as with advertisers remains to be seen.
